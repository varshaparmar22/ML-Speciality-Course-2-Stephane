-Glue ==== de-duplication === ml feature
-network latency ==== outside aws environment latency(user to sm endpoint vice-versa)
-overhead latency  ==== inside was environment latency (sm endpoint to model container vice-versa)
-conditioned disparcity ====> condition should be followed to check
-logloss = quality of probability of output, 0 is best, costfun in logistic regre,===
specify model make incorect prediction with high probability. binary & multiclass model
-lineage tracking === which dataset, training job, Hp etc. are producing given model - auditing & reproducibility
- sm pipeline=== contional steps can be added, this or that
- fastfile mode === many small file = rapid access, low latency, only access data from s3 
- lambda = lightweight models only can be deployed not recommandation kind
- transparent mmodel = how input convert into output ==== optimization should be transparent 
- sm script mode == 1.install custom lib(if any) 2. use your training script, requirement.txt, model code
3. use sm's prebuit container with above setup to launch container on endpoint
- Sm pipeline has callback step for glue, for emr direct step is there, many other steps are there too
- varying traffic --- auto scaling
- choose report, alert if only they are specified to implement
- attach the tag for cost management:
1. create tag, 
2. attach tag to resource, 
3. tie up those tag in cost allocation
- Parquet : big data, columnar, binary, compression, splittable, fast query
- avaro : serialization
- Credit bureau data : check person's financial behaviour
- Fsx for luster : sub milisec latency, hundreds of gigabytes/sec tp, millions of IOPS, high computing
- KDS : data ingestion/storage
- MSAF : processing, transforming, filtering, enrichment(like with sql)
- KDF : ingestion & deliver -  no retension
- Kafka : mainly use for transfering real-time data between apps & systems
- check pattern => bar plot, check frequency => histogram
- bedrock provide unified api, not distinct api for fm. means one api just chane fm id to get access
-  private customization=> fine tune FM as per need
- multi-colinearity : statical approach to check co-relation between feature not visualization
- TVD : maximum divergence/disparcity in outcome distribution between diff demographic group
