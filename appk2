-Glue ==== de-duplication === ml feature
-network latency ==== outside aws environment latency(user to sm endpoint vice-versa)
-overhead latency  ==== inside was environment latency (sm endpoint to model container vice-versa)
-conditioned disparcity ====> condition should be followed to check
-logloss = quality of probability of output, 0 is best, costfun in logistic regre,===
specify model make incorect prediction with high probability. binary & multiclass model
-lineage tracking === which dataset, training job, Hp etc. are producing given model - auditing & reproducibility
- sm pipeline=== contional steps can be added, this or that
- fastfile mode === many small file = rapid access, low latency, only access data from s3 
- lambda = lightweight models only can be deployed not recommandation kind
- transparent mmodel = how input convert into output ==== optimization should be transparent 
- sm script mode == 1.install custom lib(if any) 2. use your training script, requirement.txt, model code
3. use sm's prebuit container with above setup to launch container on endpoint
- Sm pipeline has callback step for glue, for emr direct step is there, many other steps are there too
