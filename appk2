-Glue ==== de-duplication === ml feature
-network latency ==== outside aws environment latency(user to sm endpoint vice-versa)
-overhead latency  ==== inside was environment latency (sm endpoint to model container vice-versa)
-conditioned disparcity ====> condition should be followed to check
-logloss = quality of probability of output, 0 is best, costfun in logistic regre,===
specify model make incorect prediction with high probability. binary & multiclass model
