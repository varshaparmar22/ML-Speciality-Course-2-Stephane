@@@ Amzon Translate @@@

- Ofcourse for translation
- support some custom Terminology like 
	* In CSV or TMX format(standard format in MT)
	* like proper name or brand name that you want to translate in some form that you know about(custom)
	* pass in those format
- Gives confidence score


@@@ Amazon Transcribe @@@

* Speech to Text
- takes input in format like FLAC, MP3, MP4, WAV
- Streaming audio is also supported from HTTP/2 or Web Socket
- Gives the text English, French, Spanish only 

* Gives speaker identification 
- no of speaker and identify they are talking

* Channel Identification
- Two callers could be transcribed separately
- two transcribe of text can be created out of that conversation
- Merging of those based on timing of utterance

* Automatic Language Identification
- you don't have to specify lang 
- It identify dominant one automatically

* Custom Vocabulary
- Vocabulary Lists - like some special words : names, acronyms
- Vocabulary Tables - like "SoundsLike", "IPA"(international Phonetic Alphabet), "DisplayAs" <- it specify how to pronounce them, and how to transcribe them

* Use Cases

$ Amazon Transcribe Call Analytics

- trained specifically for customer service and sales call
- it gives realtime transcription(transcribe) and insights of call
- identify sentiment, talk speed, interruption
- check for specific phrases like- "cancel my subscription"

$ Amazon Transcribe Medical

@@@ Amazon Polly @@@

- Text to Speech - remember parrot
- Neural 
- Many voices and languages it can create

* Lexicon
- Customize pronunciation of some specific words and phrases
- example : W3C - World Wide Web Consortium <= acronym 
- you can tell polly to map W3C to World Wide Web Consortium

* SSML Format

- Speech Synthesis Markup Language
- along with plain text it gives you some more control
- like over emphasis, pronunciation, breathing, whispering, speech-rate, pitch, pause
- by this you can make resultant sound more lot natural

* Speech Mark

- you can get encode "when word/sentence start or ends" in audio stream
- helpful for lip-synching animation


@@@ Amazon Rekognition @@@

- its computer vision

- Celebrity recognition
- face comparison
- text extracting in image
- video analysis : object, people, celebrity detection. people pathing - path that people follow when system start tracking people and identify facial landmarks like position of the left eye when person detected in video

## Inputs

- images from S3 bucket - faster way
- or can be pass as part of request
- facial recognition is depends on light, angle, visibility of eye, resolution
- video must from kinesis VS
	* H.264 encoded
	* 5-30 frames per seconds
	* resolution is more important than framerate - to get result
- Lambda - to trigger image analysis

### Rekognition Custom Label

@@@ Amazon Lex @@@

- specify inner working of alexa
- NL - chatbot engine
- generate set of rules specify how chatbot will respond for certain kind of request
- Bot is built around intents
- intents to do some specific thing like "ordering pizza intent"
- say that utterance to invoke that intent
- code (lambda function) that will fulfill that intent
- for extra info - slots are there to fill up
- like pizza size, topping, crust type, when to deliver etc

$ you can deploy this chatbot on mobile SDK - aws(create mobile app for you), facebook messenger, slack or twillio

$ Amazon Lex Automated Chatbot Designer -automated process to build chatbot
- feed transcript of existing conversation 
- it will automatically apply NLP, deep learning on it 
- remove overlap and ambiguity
- so it can generate better model

- Ensure intents are separated from each other and well defined
- integrated with amazon connect transcript
	* amazon connect : contact center from cloud which helps superior customer service at low cost


@@@ Amazon Personalize @@@

- Fully managed recommendation engine - amazon use this
- feed the data by S3 or api or javascript snippet or SDK for offline
- user specific data will be sent here
- data should be in avro format : specify what data is what and correspondence to what
- two things it will do by api request
	1. GetRecommandations : recommand product or content / similar items
	2. GetPersonalizedRanking :  rank a list of items provided/ allows editors controls/curation about 
	   what is being recommended
- by console and CLI you can do it too 
- mainly api is used

### features
- real-time or batch recommendation
- recommendation for new user and new items - cold start problem - as system don't know anything about user
	* if new user then recommend popular items
	* for new items system will compute similarity every 2 hours so
	* if someone buy it, it will have relationship with other items and it wont stay new
- contextual recommendation
	* like device type or time based on that
- similar items
- unstructured text input : if sparse data for recommendation then system will use product description and similarity between items
- intelligent user segmentation : automatically classify users into groups - marketing campaign it can be used
- business rules and filters
	* filters : recently purchased items, cant be shipped or unavailable items
	* business rule : highlight the premium content like editors'pick
- Promoted Content
	* promoted content
	* can find relevant content too even it is promoted
- Trending Now
	* for given time-period most purchasing product by customers - summer holiday clothes
- Personalized Ranking
	* Search result
	* promotion
	* Curated List

### Amazon Personalized Terminology

$$ Datasets
- User, items, interactions - all related information about these each

$$ Recipes
- type of model can be build out of AP
- USER_PERSONALIZATION - 
- PERSONALIZED RANKING
- RELATED ITEMS

$$ Solutions
- train the model with data that you provide
- optimization for relevance and some additional objectives
	* like video length, price so people spend more time on watching long video or product which has high price
	* they will be optimized on that
	* additional objectives must be numeric
- HP optimization

$$ Campaign

- deploy your model's "solution version"
- deploy capacity for generating real-time recommendation like endpoint(servers) to generate
- for creating recommendation


$$ AP Hyper parameters


%% User Personalized / Personalized Ranking %%

- hidden_dimension : how many hidden parameters are there to optimize - specify 
- bptt : back propagation through time RNN,  time factor it will take into consideration
	- so some nearby time state will be focused more than so older one
- recency_mask : weight most recent event more
- min/max_user_history_length_percentile : throw out some percentage of user history which is out of pre-specified range
					   useful when some institution person order so many product from same Website
					   so he is not representing personnel interest
					   robots kind of entries like clicking on page link or rating set by robots
					   or crawlers will also do the same looking at everything
- exploration_weight : controls relevance - by default it is 0.3.
			higher rate will form less relevance in your result
			lower rate will form high relevance
- exploration_time_age_cut_off : how far back in time you want to consider for exploration, beyond some date(age)
				 throw away the data which are 5 years old so it is not for user's current interest

%% Similar Items %%

item_id_hidden_dimension : item id hidden dimension is automatically optimized for you
item_metadata_hidden_dimension : metadata provided for item by you - specify min/max range for it to work with


### maintain AP

- keep dataset current
- frequent import of data related to users
- PutEvents api call to feed real-time data for user
- re-train the model(incremental training)
	* its called new solution version
	* updates every 2 hours
	* should do full retain every week(trainingMode=Full)

### AP Security

- Data not shared across the account 
  * tempting to pool all users data together and get better results
  * as well as from many websites to pool data and get better recommendation
  * privacy concern is point to watch over there so not good thing to do
- Data will be encrypted with KMS
- Data may  be encrypted at rest in region specific by SSE-S3
- Data in-transit from your account to the server which will process it also encrypted by TLS-1.2
- Access control by IAM
- Data in s3 must have appropriate bucket policy to access by AP
- Monitoring and Logging by CloudWatch and CloudTrail

## Pricing
- Data ingestion : per GB
- Training : per hour
- Inference : per TPS-hours(Transaction per Second) more you hit for inference more it will charge - realtime
- Batch recommendation : not realtime, per user or per item
