ML & DL diff - Ml - select model to train, manual feature extraction, DL - select architecture of model, feature extraction is automatic

- data warehouse - apply data analytics, schema on import, database - apply transaction on DATA, data lake - structure & unstructured data(artifact, ml output, analytics output, stream data)

- RedShift - columnar storage and data compression

- S3 two level security, plain text key do encryption and then plain text key will be encrypted by master key and stored in S3 too

- AWS macie - find sensitive information from data in s3 and alert user for that, or bucket because public and about to accessed

- in kinesis - at rest KMS encryption is used

- use kinesis sdk api for faster access of data rather than KPL, KCL

- Kinesis analytics available for SQL and JAVA developers

- in time-series along with trends, seasonality, noise, level = average of time data ===== components

- Glue support format conversion into csv, json, avro, parquet, orc(apache hive optimized row columnar) , xml

- athena execute query in parallel, so its fast

- analytics ability helpful in ML

- EMRFS ==> s3://, HDFS  ==> hdfs://    <=== prefix for file in EMR

- EMRFS has read after write consistency, checked by dynamodb(ddb check metadata and identify whole data is complete)

- Athena and redshift spectrum are query service which use glue data catalog

- Normalisation --- 0-1
Min will map to 0 and max will map to 1, so no - minus values 
Called min max scaler like
Nm =x - min(x)/max(x)-min(x)

- Standardization -- means will be 0, so values will be dispersed around mean, having - minus values, mean n std deviation calculated n used
S = x - mean(x)/std(x)

- Deep learning will use knn or regression for imputation of missing value 

- Deepar can be used for imputing missing value 

- Binning n encoding can be combined 

- Log transform apply on positive values n handle skewed data n outlier 

- SMOTE -- use knn

- Bigram, trigram having unigram n bigram together respectively 

- OSB- set window of 4 n do 4 words sentences n make pair of two words by removing middle words in reputation mode, first word will stay there of sentence (different for each 4 words sentences), add _ like

The_quick, The_brown, The__fox

- Cartesian product means mix two or more features and form one feature - interaction between features - attach features with _

- ReLu used in hidden layers

- tanH prefred over sigmoid, tanH suffer from vanish gradient

- regularization will introduce additional error term on loss function so weight and bias will be updated more differently 

- Regularization will increase bias and improve variance

- (Ridge - square of slope, Lasso - slope) + alpha <===== new error term

- in cnn relu AF is used  ---- cnn work good on image size 32X32

- FP is type 1 error, FN is type 2 error

- accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

- error rate = (FP+FN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

- RMSE - unit matches the unit of output - means it do square of output and reverse it with root so preferred over MSE

- Decision tree are supervised- minimize entropy which provide optimum split

- EMR supports GPU and Apache MXNet instances

- XGBoost can be used for fraud detection algorithm

- in seq2seq => encoder will have LSTM or GRU , decoder will have RNN & LSTM, it work based on seq2seq

- DeepAR can work well for cold start problem and data having seasonality factor, inference on cpu instance only

- CBOW - predict one word from given sentence, skip-gram - predict sentence from given word

- Amazon Forecast needs user to move s3 data to amazon forecast, data in forecast - AF will give data encryption by customer managed key, and IAM access to data for security

- AWS Greengrass enable edge devices to communicate to aws cloud - edge devices can communicate with each other too by IG

- AWS Greengrass core handle communication between device and cloud, & execution of Lambda

- endpoints are encrypted with KMS

- cloudwatch can be used to detect anomalies

- cloudtrail can work in many region
cloudtrail log data are encrypted by server side encryption technique in s3
