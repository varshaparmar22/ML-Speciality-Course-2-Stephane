==> Build your own alexa

-> input = speech , output = speech
-> amazon transcribe -> amazon lex automated designer -> amazon polly

==> Build your own universal translator

-> input = speech , output = speech
-> amazon transcribe -> amazon translate -> amazon polly

==> Build your own celebrity detector

-> input deeplence device and associate with recognition and fire alarm is show celebrity specified
-> aws deeplence -> amazon recognition

==> Build system to check people calling you are happy or sad or sentiment any

-> input = speech, output = sentiment with score
-> amazon transcribe -> amazon comprehend


@@@@@@@@@@@@ model implementing @@@@@@@@@@@2

accuracy => accuracy on training data
val_acc => accuracy on unseen data <- to check overfitting check this it should be high for no overfitting

- if overfitting do regularization based on algo we will choose
- if cnn then choose dropout layer to overcome overfitting

- high batch size will stuck model in local minima not good solution
- high learning rate is also same overshoot the correct solution
- small batch size required small learning rate

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ important points to remember @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@2

- mostly web application use port 8080

- standard http port is 80

- model artifact compressed in tar.gz file format

- if binary classification problem and threshold settings is there in option it can be most approx.  answer for FN/FP related issue

- Encryption needs to be implemented at the application layer (such as SSL/TLS) or by using AWS services designed for encryption

- Boosting- model training technique - increasing the accuracy by giving more weight to difficult to predict observations in sequential model training.

- if skewed(feature) dataset, and you need to uniform it by binning-apply quantile binning to convert it into bins having equal no of observation

- Training for more epochs often leads to overfitting, as the model starts to memorize rather than generalize from the training data.

- silhouette score if >1 data point very far from nearest cluster, 0 on one cluster or on boundary of two cluster, -1 assign in wrong cluster

- EMRFS -Hadoop file system API, allowing direct interaction between EMR-hosted applications like MapReduce & S3. By using the `s3://` file prefix.

- S3A (Amazon S3A File System) Hadoop-compatible interface for accessing data in S3-accessing public data sets without requiring AWS credentials.

- Amazon Comprehend use LDA feature - for topic modeling

- if NN has more layers than use ReLU as it solve vanishing gradient problem because of more layers for convergence

- if accuracy is not as required you can change activation function 

- if convergence issue than it is indicating problem with gradient loss - use Relu to solve it - specially if Network is complex already

- if outliers are in dataset we can use median values for imputation

- labeling by ground truth incorporates both precision and speed as it provide automatic labeling by self learning algo and human reviewing

- Reckognition in asw if custom logo or character you need to identify, fir train recoknition with labeled dataset(even a small one). final model will be created and trained and you will get api for that model to use for your specific use case - you need labeled dataset for custom reckognition

- blazing text can handle n-gram technique so it break word in subword and handle OOV by aggregating subword vector so good performance on morphologically rich language.

- access to s3 in sagemaker handled by IAM roles & policy not by bucket access control list(ACL) - role based access control
